#+title: Exercise 5.5

Evaluate ~(fact 3)~, before the first execution of ~(goto (label
fact-loop))~:

#+begin_example
  fact-done ;; saved continue
  3         ;; saved n
#+end_example

Before the second execution of ~(goto (label fact-loop))~:

#+begin_example
  fact-done ;; saved continue
  3         ;; saved n
  after-fact ;; saved continue
  2          ;; saved n
#+end_example

The third execution of the loop goes straight to the base case.

Before the first execution of ~(assign val ...)~:

#+begin_example
  fact-done ;; saved continue
  3         ;; saved n
#+end_example

Now ~n~ holds 2, ~val~ holds 1, and ~continue~ holds ~after-fact~.

Before the second execution of ~(assign val ...)~:

#+begin_example
  ;; the stack is empty
#+end_example

Now ~n~ holds 3, ~val~ holds 2, and ~continue~ holds ~fact-done~.
