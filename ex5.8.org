#+title: Exercise 5.8

With the simulator is written, register ~a~ will hold 3 when control
reaches ~there~.

This is because the instructions are processed from the end to the
start, and the label entries are add to the label table using
~cons~. Thus, the first label ~here~ appears earlier in the label table
than the second label ~here~, and its corresponding location will be
returned by ~lookup-label~, since ~lookup-label~ uses ~assoc~, which finds
the first entry in the table matches the given key.
