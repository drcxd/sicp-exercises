Exercise 4.18

The procedure does not work if the internal definitions are scanned
out as shown in the exercise. This is because e2 depends on the value
of y, but when e2 is evaluated, y's value is still *unassigned*.

The transformation described in the book does not share this problem,
so it will work.
