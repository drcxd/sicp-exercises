Exercise 4.15

When evaluating (try try) the evaluator has to evaluate (halts? try
try) first.

If it returns true, then it means (try try) will halt. However, this
makes the (run-forever) branch gets executed, which means (try try)
can not halt. Thus, there is a contradiction.

If (halts? try try) returns false, then it means (try try) will never
return. This makes the 'halted branch gets executed, and thus (try
try) should return a value and halts. Thus, there is a contracition.

From the contradictions above, we can conclude that such a halts?
procedure does not exist.
