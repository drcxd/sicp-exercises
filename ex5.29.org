#+title: Exercise 5.29

| n | total pushes | maximum depth |
| 2 |           72 |            13 |
| 3 |          128 |            18 |
| 4 |          240 |            23 |
| 5 |          408 |            28 |
| 6 |          688 |            33 |

* a

Maximum depth is =13 + (n - 1) * 5=.

* b

\(k\) is the overhead of caused during the application, comparing,
branching, and adding the results of ~(fib (- n 1))~ and ~(fib (- n 2))~.

Assume \(S(0) = S(1) = t\), by the inductive formula \(S(n) = S(n-1) +
S(n-2) + k\), we have:

\begin{cases}
S(2) &= 2t + k \\
S(3) &= 3t + 2k \\
S(4) &= 5t + 3k \\
...
\end{cases}

The pattern is obvious that

\[S(n) = t \cdot \mathrm{Fib}(n+1) + (n-1)k\]

The exact value of \(t\) and \(k\) can be determined by counting the
number of pushes in the corresponding processes.
