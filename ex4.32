Exercise 4.32

(define (f x)
  (display x)
  x)

(cons-stream (f 1) (f 2))

This will cause the evaluator print 1.

(cons (f 1) (f 2))

With the lazy lists, the evaluator will not print anything.

We can use this extra laziness to write the following code:

(define x (cons x x))

Though I do not see how this is useful in real application.

Sad.
