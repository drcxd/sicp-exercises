#+title: Exercise 4.68

First an empty list's reverse is also an empty list:

#+begin_src scheme
  (rule (reverse () ()))
#+end_src

Then a list's reverse is its ~car~ appended to the reverse of its ~cdr~:

#+begin_src scheme
  (rule (reverse ?x (?y . ?z))
        (and (reverse ?z ?u)
             (append-to-form ?u ?y ?x)))
#+end_src
