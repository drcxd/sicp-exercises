Exercise 4.19

Based on the implementation in exercise 4.16, I have to side with
Alyssa.

Implement the behavior described by Eva is difficult, what I can
devise is to first analyze all the internal definitions and see if
there are dependencies among these expressions. If there are no
circular dependencies, then we can evaluate definition expressions in
a certain order that althogh variables are defined sequencially, the
result is no different from simultaneous definitions. However, this
does not work when there are circular dependencies between
definitions.
