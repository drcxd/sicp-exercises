#+title: Exercise 5.14

The output of the program:

#+begin_example
  1

  (total-pushes = 0 maximum-depth = 0)
  2

  (total-pushes = 2 maximum-depth = 2)
  3

  (total-pushes = 4 maximum-depth = 4)
  4

  (total-pushes = 6 maximum-depth = 6)
  5

  (total-pushes = 8 maximum-depth = 8)
  6

  (total-pushes = 10 maximum-depth = 10)
  7

  (total-pushes = 12 maximum-depth = 12)
  8

  (total-pushes = 14 maximum-depth = 14)
  9

  (total-pushes = 16 maximum-depth = 16)
  10

  (total-pushes = 18 maximum-depth = 18)
#+end_example

Obviously, the number of pushes and the maximum depth both equal to
\((n - 1) * 2\), \(n\) is the input value.
