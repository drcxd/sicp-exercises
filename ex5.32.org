#+title: Exercise 5.32

* a

See =explicit-control-evaluator.rkt=.

* b

Alyssa's idea is true for the execution of single
instruction. However, a compiler can analyze a sequence of multiple
instructions and make optimizations specific to this specific sequence
of multiple instructions. A evaluator can not do such optimization
because when executing an instruction, it may have no knowledge about
the next instruction.
