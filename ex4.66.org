#+title: Exercise 4.66

For example, in Ben's new system, if the following expression is
evaluated:

#+begin_src scheme
  (sum ?amount (and (wheel ?who)
                    (salary ?who ?amount)))
#+end_src

according to exercise 4.65, Oliver Warbucks' salary would be
accumulated four times.

To solve this problem, the result of the query must be filtered. For
each frame, we can check its bindings for the variables that appear in
the query pattern. We save such bindings stored in a list, and before
any new bindings are added to such a list, we make sure there are no
existing bindings have the same value. Finally, the accumulation
procedure runs on the filtered bindings.
