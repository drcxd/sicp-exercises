#+title: Exercise 5.10

For example, we can change the syntax of an operation expression from

#+begin_src scheme
  ((op operator) (operand-1) ... (operand-n))
#+end_src

to

#+begin_src scheme
  ((op operator (operand-1) ... (operand-n)))
#+end_src


We only have to modify the procedure ~operation-exp-operands~ as
follows:

#+begin_src scheme
  (define (operation-exp-operands operation-exp)
    (cddr (car operation-exp)))
#+end_src
