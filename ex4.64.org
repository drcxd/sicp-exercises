#+title: Exercise 4.64

The original rule:

#+begin_src scheme
  (rule (outranked-by ?staff-person ?boss)
        (or (supervisor ?staff-person ?boss)
            (and (supervisor ?staff-person ?middle-manager)
                 (outranked-by ?middle-manager ?boss)))) ;; (1)
#+end_src

Louis' rule:

#+begin_src scheme
  (rule (outranked-by ?staff-person ?boss)
        (or (supervisor ?staff-person ?boss)
            (and (outranked-by ?middle-manager ?boss) ;; (2)
                 (supervisor ?staff-person ?middle-manager))))
#+end_src

I have no idea why the text said "After answering, the system goes
into an infinite loop." According to my analysis, the system goes into
an infinite loop without answering the question.

In Louis' rule, evaluating an ~outranked-by~ expression directly invokes
another ~outranked-by~ expression, which leads to infinite recursive
call. This is not the case in the original rule, since at some time,
the ~supervisor~ expression will evaluate to false and suspend the
evaluation of the following ~outranked-by~ expression.
