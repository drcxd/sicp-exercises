Exercise 4.45

I am going to partition the sentence into 5 parts:

1. The professor
2. lectures
3. to the student
4. in the class
5. with the cat

The first part is always parsed as a noun phrase. The different
parsing of the sentence depends on how to combine the other 4 parts.

I am going to use a simplified notation to represent the different
parsings:

1. (((1 2) 3) 4) This means:
   a. the professor in the class
   b. the professor with the cat

2. ((1 (2 3)) 4) This means:
   a. the student in the class
   b. the professor with the cat

3. (1 ((2 3) 4)) This means:
   a. the student in the class
   b. the student with the cat

4. (1 (2 (3 4))) This means (ridiculous but grammarly possible):
   a. the class with the cat
   b. the student in the class

5. ((1 2) (3 4)) This mens (also ridiculous but grammarly possible):
   a. the class with the cat
   b. the professor in the class
