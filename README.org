This repository contains my solutions for the exercises of Structure
and Interpretation of Computer Programs by Abelson.

To find the solution of a certain exercise, search for the number of
the exercise, for example "Exercise 4.21".

Please note that solutions are scattered among multiple branches,
since I find it difficult to maintain them all in a single
branch. This is because some of the exercises are based on different
foundations, for example, some are based on analyzing evaluator while
the others are based on normal order evaluator.

I will try to put the most of the solutions in the main/master branch,
and name the other branches so it should be obvious what it is
about. Anyway, if you fail to find certain solution in one branch, try
search the others.
