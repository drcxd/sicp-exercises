#+title: Exercise 4.48

I am going to extend noun phrases to include adjectives.

#+begin_src scheme
  (define (parse-simple-noun-phrase)
    (amb (list 'simple-noun-phrase
               (parse-word articles)
               (parse-word adjectives)
               (parse-word nouns))
         (list 'simple-noun-phrase
               (parse-word articles)
               (parse-word nouns))))
#+end_src

This solution looks really simple: on the first branch of ~amb~, we try
to parse a simple noun phrase which contains an adjective, if this
fails, then we fall back to the original simple noun phrase.

This implementation does not share the defect of Louis Reasoner's
implementation of ~parse-verb-phrase~, because there is no recursive
call which introduces new branches.

However, I wonder are there any more elegant solutions. This one
should work, but it looks ugly and may not be extendable. The purpose
of reading SICP is to write code that is easy to maintain and
extend. The code presented by the author usually meets this
requirement, since I always feel easy to add some modifications to
it. However, is my modified code share the same nature? I doubt it.

After thing about this problem for a while, I found that my
implementation, although correct in some way, is really limited. It
can only parse phrases such as "a tall tree", but not "a tall straight
tree".

So, let me extend it so that it can parse an article followed by
arbitrary adjectives followed by a noun.

First let's define the adjective phrase. An adjective phrase consists
of an adjective and a noun, or an adjective and another adjective
phrase.

#+begin_src scheme
  (define (parse-adjective-phrase)
    (define (maybe-extend adj-phrase)
      (list 'adj-phrase adj-phrase (amb (parse-word nouns)
                                        (parse-adjective-phrase))))
    (maybe-extend (parse-word adjectives)))
#+end_src

Then we modify the ~parse-simple-noun~ to use
~parse-adjective-noun-phrase~:

#+begin_src scheme
  (define (parse-simple-noun-phrase)
    (list 'simple-noun-phrase
          (parse-word articles)
          (am (parse-adjective-phrase)
              (parse-word nouns))))
#+end_src

I am more satisfied with this solution. For now.
