#+title: Exercise 5.30

* a

I do not understand why the text says that "This is lots of
work". What we need to do is to check the return value of
~lookup-variable-value~ and if it is the special value, then we jump to
~signal-error~, we only need to modify the code under the label
~ev-variable~. Why this is lots of work?

Maybe the text only uses ~lookup-variable-value~ as an example, and
there are other kinds of operations that can be handled similarly? For
example, assignment does not return any value. To detect errors
occurred during assignment, the procedures ~set-variable-value!~ must
return a value to indicate errors.

Should we consider malformed input, such as ~(if)~ and ~(lambda)~?  This
requires test and return special value for almost all the syntax
procedures.

* b

Only implemented error check for ~car~ as an example.
