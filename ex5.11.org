#+title: Exercise 5.11

* a

The two instructions after the label ~afterfib-n-2~:

#+begin_src scheme
  (assign n (reg val))
  (restore val)
#+end_src

can be replaced by a single instruction:

#+begin_src scheme
  (restore n)
#+end_src

Then ~val~ holds ~Fib(n-2)~ and ~n~ holds ~Fib(n-1)~. This does not change the
result of executing the instruction

#+begin_src scheme
  (assign val (op +) (reg val) (reg n))
#+end_src

* b
