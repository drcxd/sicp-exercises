My plan is to use the procedure runtime to measure the time spends in
analyzing and executing.

For example, first we measure the time analyzing (lambda (x) x) as
follows:

> (define x 0)
> (define y 0)
> (begin (set! x (runtime)) (analyze '(lambda (x) x)) (set! y (runtime)))
> (- y x)
877

Then we measure the time executing it as follows:

> (define z (analyze '(lambda (x) x)))
> (begin (set! x (runtime)) (z the-global-environment) (set! y (runtime)))
> (- y x)
580
