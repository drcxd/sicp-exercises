The foundamental difference between the analyze-seqeunce defined in
the text and that defined by Alyssa is that the version defined in the
text executes only the code in the sequence when the analyzed result
is evaluated, while Alyssa's version not only execute those code but
also the "driver" code of the evaluator. To be specific, extra cdr,
null?, car will be called during the execution of the analyzed
sequence if Alyssa's analyze-sequence is used. For the
analyze-sequence defined in the text, these work has been done at
analyze-time and the run-time overhead is only function calls.
