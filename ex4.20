Exercise 4.20 b

I would skip drawying the diagram but pointing out the difference
between letrec and let, because I can not see how the diagram tells
the difference.

When using letrec, each symbol's definition can reference other
symbols defined in letrec. While using let, each symbol's definition
can not reference other symbols defined in letrec.

If we replace letrec with let for the example in text, then the
definition of even? inside let actually references odd? in its
enclosing environment, rather than the odd? defined inside let.
