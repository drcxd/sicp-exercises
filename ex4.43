Exercise 4.43

This problem is more complicated than previous ones, because of its
last constraint "Gabrielle's father owns the yacht that is named after
Dr.Parker's daughter."

Our program to solve this problem:

(define daughter-names '(Gabrielle Lorna Mary Melissa Rosalind))
(define (get-father daughter) (car daughter))
(define (get-name daughter) (cadr daughter))
(define (get-daughter father) (car father))
(define (get-yacht father (cadr father)))

(define Barnacle (list (amb daughter-names) (amb daughter-names)))
(require (not (= (get-daughter Barnacle) (get-yacht Barnacle))))
(require (= (get-yacht Barnacle) 'Gabrielle))
(require (= (get-daughter Barnacle) 'Melissa))

(define Downing (list (amb daughter-names) (amb daughter-names)))
(require (not (= (get-daughter Downing) (get-yacht Downing))))
(require (= (get-yacht Downing) 'Melissa))

(define Hall (list (amb daughter-names) (amb daughter-names)))
(require (not (= (get-daughter Hall) (get-yacht Hall))))
(require (= (get-yacht Hall) 'Rosalind))

(define Moore (list (amb daughter-names) (amb daughter-names)))
(require (not (= (get-daughter Moore) (get-yacht Moore))))
(require (= (get-daughter Moore) 'Mary))
(require (= (get-yacht Moore) 'Lorna))

(define Parker (list (amb daughter-names) (amb daughter-names)))
(require (not (= (get-daughter Parker) (get-yacht Parker))))

(define fathers (list Barnacle Downing Hall Moore Parker))

(define Gabrielle (list (amb fathers) 'Gabrielle))
(require (= (get-daughter (get-father Gabrielle)) 'Gabrielle))

(define Lorna (list (amb fathers) 'Lorna))
(require (= (get-daughter (get-father Lorna)) 'Lorna))

(define Mary (list (amb fathers) 'Mary))
(require (= (get-daughter (get-father Mary)) 'Mary))

(define Melissa (list (amb fathers) 'Melissa))
(require (= (get-daughter (get-father Melissa)) 'Melissa))

(define Rosalind (list (amb fathers) 'Rosalind))
(require (= (get-daughter (get-father Rosalind)) 'Rosalind))

(require (= (get-yacht (get-father Gabrielle)) (get-daughter Barnacle)))

(require (distinct? (map get-father daughters)))
(require (distinct? (map get-daughter fathers)))
(require (distinct? (map get-yacht fathers)))

(get-father Lorna)

TODO verify the correctness of the program.

If we do not know that Mary Ann's last name is Moore, then there are
two possible answers:

1. Lorna's father is Downing, this is the same as the answer when we
know that Mary Ann's last anme is Moore.

| Father   | Barnacle  | Downing | Hall      | Moore | Parker   |
| Daughter | Melissa   | Lorna   | Gabrielle | Mary  | Rosalind |
| yacht    | Gabrielle | Melissa | Rosalind  | Lorna | Mary     |

2. Lorna's father is Parker.

| Father   | Barnacle  | Downing  | Hall     | Moore     | Parker |
| Daughter | Melissa   | Rosalind | Mary     | Gabrielle | Lorna  |
| yacht    | Gabrielle | Melissa  | Rosalind | Lorna     | Mary   |
