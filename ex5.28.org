#+title: Exercise 5.28

Iterative:

| n | total pushes | maximum depth |
| 1 |           70 |            17 |
| 2 |          107 |            20 |
| 3 |          144 |            23 |
| 4 |          181 |            26 |
| 5 |          218 |            29 |

Recursive:

| n | total pushes | maximum depth |
| 1 |           18 |            11 |
| 2 |           52 |            19 |
| 3 |           86 |            27 |
| 4 |          120 |            35 |
| 5 |          154 |            43 |

Both versions of the factorial procedure now uses stack space that
grows linearly with the input.
