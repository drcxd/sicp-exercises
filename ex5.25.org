#+title: Exercise 5.25

This exercise involves implementing the normal order evaluator in the
explicit control evaluator. Basically, what I have done is to
implement the code presented in section 4.2.2 of the book.

To be more specific, the procedures involve the syntax about thunks:
~delay-it~, ~thunk?~, ~thunk-exp~ and ~thunk-env~ are implemented as Scheme
procedures, like other syntax procedures.

Procedures ~actual-value~, ~force-it~ are implemented using the machine
instructions. Other modifications to the evaluator are also embedded
in the evaluator itself. Most of them are about the procedures
application.

Note that I have not implemented the memorization of thunks.
